# Real Time Bus Tracker 

## Map Animation Exercise

###   In this activity, I will be using the MBTA bus data to determine stops between Harvard and MIT Universities. I've also added an animated marker on the map to highlight the bus routes.

###  To executre, simply browse to the index.html file and on the display, click on the "Show Stops Between MIT and Harvard" button.
